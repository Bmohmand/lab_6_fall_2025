        TODO: Implement this function to extract robot commands from a single line of text.

        HINTS:
        - The parsing logic will depend on exactly how you format your GPT model/system prompt!
        - The commands you define here will be used to execute the commands in the execute_command function, which you'll also implement below.
        - Think carefully about the sequential structure of the LLM's output and how your system prompt tells the model to format commands.
        - For example, if your prompt instructs GPT to output one command per line, you should parse only a single command from each line.
        - You may need to match/substitute multiple possible phrasings (e.g. "move forward", "walk forward") to a canonical command like "move".
        - Construct and return a list of action strings (e.g. ['move', 'turn_left']) extracted from the line.
        - Test your command extraction logic carefully, since if the output is not sequential, your robot may behave out of order!

        Example:
            line = "Move forward"
            returns ['move']
